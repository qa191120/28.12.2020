         home work:
         1. input array size from user
            create int array in the given size
            populate the array with random numbers
            sum the array
            print the average number
         2. create an array of 5 Strings (hint: String[] word = new String[5])
            create a for loop and input words from the user into the array
            now print the array in a for loop
            *** etgar: print the average length of the words, i.e.  hello java book pro about. the words length is  [5,4,4,3,5] => average=4.2
         3. create int array A with random numbers (size of 5)  
            create int array B with random numbers (size of 5)
            create int array C (size of 5) which each element will be the sum of A+B
            for exmaple: 
            A [ 5, 8, 6, 2, 3]  -- random
            B [ 3, 7, 8, 3, 1]  -- random
            C [ 8,15,14, 5, 4]  -- sum
            *etgar: create int array D which will contain the larger name from A or B
            *D[ 5, 8, 8, 3, 3]
            *etgar: create in array E which will be concat of the array A and B
            *E[ 5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 3, 7, 8, 3, 1]
         3. ***etgar crazy:
            input number of classes from user
            for each size input number of students
            input all numbers from user
            calculate the average of each class in an array
            calculate the average of averages
